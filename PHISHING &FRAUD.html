If you’ve encountered such an incident, please know that it is fraud, and you must report it immediately to stay safe from a phishing attempt.<br>
            For assistance on a YummyBites order, click on the ‘Help’ section on the YummyBites - there is no other help channel available.</p>
        <p>Watch out for:

            Suspicious links sent to you via WhatsApp, SMS or email.
            Proactive calls from unauthorised numbers requesting for personal/financial information.
            Scamsters claiming you have a refund amount pending, in an attempt to get you to disclose sensitive information.
